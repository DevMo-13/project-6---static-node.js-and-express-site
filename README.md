# STATIC NODE.JS AND EXPRESS SITE
 Treehouse FSJS Techdegree Project 6 - Static Node.js and Express Site

This project utilizes Node.js, Express, and Pug to create a portfolio site to showcase the projects I've built so far in my techdegree. The site contains a modern landing page, an about page with my contact info, and a series of project pages to show off and detail my first 5 projects from the Treehouse FSJS techdegree.
